## Practice, practice and practice...

### Sharing
I've always had problems with communicating effectively. Recently, I got rattled during an interview and skipped important points when answering questions. When discussing with people, being able to share exactly what you think is beneficial. By sharing my experiences, thoughts, and ramblings, i'll hopefully get better at expressing myself and understanding how others think and feel.

### Skills
By documenting my personal projects, I'll get pressured to properly pursue projects. Whether it be a quick 5 minute project or a long term one, skills are honed. I think it would be fun to let out my frustrations and accomplishments through this blog.

### Writing
Writing properly is a skill that slowly erodes over time. Without deadlines looming over my head, most of my writings are composed of casual conversations with bb, friends, and family.

### Consistency
"How to be great? Just be good, repeatably"
