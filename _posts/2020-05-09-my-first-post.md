I haven't really thought about much on what to do after setting up this blog.

For my plans regarding this blog, here's a list off the top of my head:
* Utilize the page as a portfolio for showcasing skills
* Use this page for tracking my personal projects over the years
* Display my goals and aspirations
* Share random thoughts and ideas
* Compile interesting materials that I stumbled upon
