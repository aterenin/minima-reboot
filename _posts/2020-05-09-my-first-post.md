#Henlo World!

I haven't really thought about much on what to do after setting up this blog.

Anyway, here's a list off the top of my head on what my plans are:
1. Utilize the page as a portfolio for showcasing skills
2. Use this page for tracking my personal projects over the years
3. Display my goals and aspirations
4. Share random thoughts and ideas
5. Compile interesting materials that I stumbled upon
